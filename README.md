#Summary Python vs. Javascript

Programmers hate to memorize everything - there's too much! Instead, we like to be familiar with the basics and understand how to solve problems, and look up functions when we need them. 

In this lesson we will work together to make a reference chart comparing Python and Javascript. For every concept that has a counterpart, we will show how it works in both languages. For concepts that only work in one language, we'll leave that row in the other language's column conspicuously blank.

Here are a few concepts to start with
+ Interpreter
+ Comments
+ Variable Assignment
+ Math operators
+ Conditionals
